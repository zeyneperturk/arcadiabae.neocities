            hi! i'm zeynep, currently a junior student studying information systems and technologies. i see the internet as an 
            endless landscape of us humans' thoughts and experiences, whether they are good or bad. it is also a space where anyone can
            express themselves in any form they want, be it photographs, music, writing and my favorite, gifs. therefore, i find the
            thought of having a space of my own, with no limitations or whatsoever, quite exciting! hence, i started this site! i wanted
            it to reflect my personality by bringing everything i love into one place. working on it has been so fun, i hope you also enjoy
            your time while exploring it. one last thing i really love about the internet is its ability to connect people anytime, anywhere.
            no matter the kilometers between us or the hours apart, this text still found you!

            growing up, i didn't have many people to talk about my interests, as understandably not many at my middle school were interested
            in talking about my little pony. but it was so easy to find fanarts, music, news and full episodes of it online. and that was my
            introduction to the internet. instagram, youtube, tumblr and vine were so fun back then. spending time on them for years and years, 
            it is safe to say that internet culture had an impact on my youth in the most beautiful way possible. you may be thinking that 'beautiful'
            wouldn't be the best word to describe the impact on the internet on someone, but in my case it is. 
            <br>
            <br>
            trends like ice bucket challenge, water bottle flip challenge, fidget spinners and youtube rewinds were really fun to keep up with. also,
            dramas and controversies between people on the internet were something else back then. honestly i think everything about internet went downhill
            after tseries become the most subscribed youtube channel by dethroning pewdiepie. lastly, the meme culture has always been fascinating to me, 
            when i think about it. it's almost like everyone on the internet were talking in some other language, expressing themselves only by 
            an image and a short text.
            <br>

            the internet is not the same anymore, but i loved growing up with it.
